    "# 1. Feature Engineering Objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of feature engineering in this project is to transform raw loan applicant data into a **consistent, numerical, and model-ready format** while preserving the underlying information relevant to **loan default risk**. Since the dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical variables, appropriate preprocessing is required to ensure that all models can effectively learn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering will be performed with the following principles in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifier columns** (such as unique loan IDs) will be excluded, as they do not carry predictive information.\n",
    "- **Numerical and categorical features** will be handled using suitable transformations to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- **Data leakage will be strictly avoided** by learning all preprocessing steps exclusively from the training data.\n",
    "- **A consistent engineered feature set** will be used across all models to enable fair and meaningful comparison between algorithms.\n",
    "- The **feature engineering pipeline will be reproducible and deployment-ready**, allowing the trained model to be reliably applied to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the engineered features support **robust model training**, **reliable evaluation**, and **future deployment** without introducing bias or inconsistencies.\n"

    "# 2. Train–Test Split Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into training and test sets **before any preprocessing or feature transformations** (such as encoding or scaling) to prevent data leakage and ensure a fair evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **target variable (`y`)** is defined as the `Default` column, which indicates whether a loan default occurred.\n",
    "- The **feature matrix (`X`)** consists of all remaining columns excluding:\n",
    "  - the target variable (`Default`)\n",
    "  - the unique identifier column (`LoanID`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LoanID` column is removed because it serves only as a record identifier and does not contain predictive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the observed **class imbalance** in the target variable, a **stratified split** is used to preserve the proportion of defaulters and non-defaulters in both the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is divided into **80% training data** and **20% test data**, providing sufficient data for model training while retaining an unseen test set for final evaluation.\n",
    "- A **fixed random state** is used during the split to ensure reproducibility of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection and hyperparameter tuning will be performed using **cross-validation on the training set** only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **test set will be used exactly once**, after model selection is complete, to evaluate the final model’s performance and provide an unbiased estimate of generalization ability.\n"
